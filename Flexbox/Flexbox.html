                <p>The Avengers were a team of extraordinary individuals, with either superpowers or other
                    special
                    characteristics. Its purpose was to protect global stability from inner or extraterrestrial
                    threats. Though primarily affiliated with the United States of America, they worked with the
                    peaceful interests of the whole world in mind rather than a specific country or
                    organization.
                    The Avengers were first assembled by S.H.I.E.L.D. when Loki invaded Earth with his Chitauri
                    army
                    to conquer the planet. The team defeated him and went their separate ways for a while.

                    After S.H.I.E.L.D. became a defunct agency due to HYDRA infiltration, Stark Industries
                    remodeled
                    Stark Tower into Avengers Tower and the team joined together in the fight against HYDRA.
                    After
                    they finished the fight, Tony Stark built Ultron hoping that the A.I. would be able to
                    defend
                    the world from any threats necessary. The plan backfired and Ultron started a war against
                    humanity, forcing Tony and the Avengers to fight Ultron. When Ultron was defeated, the team
                    gained new recruits and relocated to the New Avengers Facility.

                    Under Captain America's leadership, the team successfully completed several operations
                    around
                    the world, until the amount of collateral damage caused during their conflicts caused the
                    United
                    Nations to pass the Sokovia Accords in an attempt to regulate their actions. The differences
                    in
                    opinions created a rift within the organization which split the Avengers into two factions,
                    one
                    led by Iron Man and another by Captain America. After Captain America was able to stop
                    Helmut
                    Zemo, the instigator of their fight, the team was divided; Iron Man, Vision and War Machine
                    remained official members, while a small group consisting of Captain America, Black Widow,
                    and
                    Falcon continued to operate in the shadows. Stark would try to boost the Avengers'
                    membership by
                    inviting Spider-Man to join, but the young hero turned down the offer to remain closer to
                    the
                    people he had sworn to protect.

                    Two years after the Accords were ratified, Thanos, the Mad Titan warlord and instigator
                    behind
                    Loki's Chitauri invasion, launched a crusade against the universe in his quest to gather the
                    Infinity Stones. The Avengers were split up into different groups as they fought to combat
                    Thanos before he succeeded, joining forces with the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the
                    Wakandans,
                    and the Guardians of the Galaxy in the process, with Iron Man and Spider Man going to Titan
                    alongside Doctor Strange and meeting and allying with Star-Lord, Nebula, Mantis and Drax to
                    try
                    to stop Thanos while Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, War Machine, Falcon, Thor, Groot,
                    Rocket and Scarlet Witch protected Vision from the Black Order in Wakanda. While the team on
                    Wakanda was successful in killing Thanos' minions, the team fighting on Titan was defeated.
                    Thanos arrived and overpowered the heroes on Wakanda with ease before killing Vision in
                    order to
                    receive the Mind Stone, thus completing the Infinity Gauntlet. Even after Thor severely
                    wounded
                    him, Thanos still managed to eradicate half of the universe's population, triumphing over
                    Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Several Avengers were among the victims, including Falcon, Scarlet
                    Witch and Spider-Man; with only Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow, and War
                    Machine surviving the war.

                    In the aftermath of the Snap, the remaining members of the Avengers were joined by Rocket
                    Raccoon, Nebula, Captain Marvel, and Okoye as they tried to maintain order on Earth and the
                    wider universe.</p>
