            <td style="color:dodgerblue">Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects - and he's bored out of his
                mind. But all that
                changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami, a death god. Any
                human
                whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death
                Note
                to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary
                detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble
                goal... or his life?

                Boredom
                Light tests the boundaries of the Death Note's powers as L and the police begin to close in.
                Luckily,
                Light's father is the head of the Japanese National Police Agency and leaves vital information about
                the
                case lying around the house. With access to his father's files, Light can keep one step ahead of the
                authorities. But who is the strange man following him, and how can Light guard against enemies whose
                names he doesn't know?</td>

                When

                them
                lost an arm and a leg...and the other became nothing but a soul locked into a body of living steel.
                Now
                Edward is an agent of the government, a slave of the military-alchemical complex, using his unique
                powers to obey orders...even to kill. Except his powers aren't unique. The world has been ravaged by
                the
                abuse of alchemy. And in pursuit of the ultimate alchemical treasure, the Philosopher's Stone, their
                enemies are even more ruthless than they are...</td>
